# Rovio Technical Test

Technical test for Rovio couple of years ago, the goal is to create a turn based game.

This is very challenging test because i have to work around the provided framework instead from scratch.

First time i had to create this type of game and i think final result is pretty fun to work and play with.

My idea is a deep tactical games that's put importance of positioning, chaining attacks and some good luck.

The AI also have to be smart and provide challenging gameplay.

And i got an offer but I made hard decision to help CD Projekt RED with cyberpunk instead.

I really recommend to join their team, they have interesting project, great team and many room to grow as engineer there and on top of that Sweden is nice country!
