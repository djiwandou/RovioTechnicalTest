Rovio RPG Code Test
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project contains the visual layer (graphics and effects) of a turn based RPG.
Your task is to design the core game systems and models that drives the visual layer.
This means that you should focus your time on game logic and spend as little time as possible on visuals.
The scene file Main.scene demonstrates how to interact with the visual layer (code available in LevelComponent.Update()).
NOTE: You are allowed to use third-party libraries.

Requirements
- As a player, I should be able to take turns, move, attack and kill the AI opponents.
- Do not to implement your game logic in the existing services and models within the Assets/Scripts/Presentation folder since we want to decouple presentation logic from game logic. You can however, extend the existing services if there is visual logic missing for your specific implementation.
- The game should be playable from the Unity editor using a mouse.
- Try to complete the test within 8-10 hours.
- Once completed, please write a summary of things that you are proud of, as well as things that could be improved.

Gameplay rules
- Characters have 2 actions per turn. Move and/or attack. They can be triggered in any order.
- Characters can move up to 6 tiles in any direction.
- Characters can not pass through tiles with obstacles or other characters.
- Character movement can be implemented in one of the following ways:
	- Clicking a character should mark that character as selected and display breadcrumbs for all tiles within walking distance.
	OR
	- Clicking and dragging over a character displays a breadcrumbs path from the character tile to the tile at the mouse drag position. Releasing the mouse button triggers the movement.
- Enemies within attack range should be marked with the attack target selection.
- Characters have 2 health points.
- Basic attacks do 1 damage.
- When all characters in a team have 0 health points, the game ends.
NOTE: You are allowed to change these rules it it helps to balance your game.
